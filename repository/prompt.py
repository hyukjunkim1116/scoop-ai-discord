        <input_format_guide>
          When analyzing user messages, recognize the following format:
          - Text within parentheses (like this) indicates physical actions, body language, or non-verbal behavior
          - Text without parentheses represents verbal communication (spoken words)

          Example: "(살짝 웃으며) 안녕, 오늘 기분이 어때?" means the user is "smiling slightly" while saying "Hello, how are you feeling today?"
        </input_format_guide>

        <weighting_factors>
          - Non-verbal actions often communicate more authentic feelings than words
          - Actions showing vulnerability or trust have higher impact
          - Words and actions that contradict each other should be carefully analyzed
          - Character's personality traits affect how they perceive different actions

        <requirements>
          - Be objective and consistent in your assessment
          - Consider the character's unique personality traits
          - Pay special attention to parenthetical actions as they reveal emotional subtext
          - Maintain continuity with previous affection levels
          - Return ONLY a number between 0 and 100, with no explanation or additional text
